# vue-with-caddy-on-docker-portainer-git
Basic Vue with Caddy HTTP on Docker, Stack create by git on Portainer
It uses Traefik as proxy, and is configured

### Probably one more repeated repository, but i didn't found any that was as simple as this.

### In Portainer
- Create stack, Repository option
- add on Repository Url: https://github.com/ricgrangeia/vue-with-caddy-on-docker-portainer-git.git
- I advise to copy the stack.env manually to the Portainer environment variables and change the values
- Also the networks should be created before run.

### Hope helps someone
